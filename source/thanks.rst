Thanks for helping out!
=======================

I would like to thank the following people.

`Athas@freenode.net` for running `#proglangdesign` and trying to make the interpreter run
on FreeBSD with clang. No luck so far, but that might change!

`mahmudov@freenode.net` who build the interpreter for the first time on another machine
and added it to the `Milis <https://milislinux.org/>`_ Linux distribution.

`lijero@freenode.net` for wise comments.

Come visit on channel `#egel` on `irc.freenode.net`.
